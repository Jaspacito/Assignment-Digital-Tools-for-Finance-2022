1. install a nice text editor;

VScode 


2. install Python (best with anaconda or miniconda) and make sure you can run pip or conda from the command line;

which pip 
/Users/Jasper/opt/anaconda3/bin/pip
which pip3 
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin/pip3


3. install cookiecutter;

cookiecutter -V 
Cookiecutter 1.7.3 from /Users/Jasper/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (Python 3.9)


4. create a directory for the group project you are supposed to hand in as the graded assignment for this course and set up a basic structure for it (best by using cookiecutter and trimming unnecessary stuff);

cd /Users/Jasper && pwd 

cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science # project_name: DTFF2022, repo: DTFF2022 


5. create an environment variable RESEARCH_PATH (don't forget about the platform-specific '&' and '%') referencing the folder with all your projects;

RESEARCH_PATH = "/Users/Jasper/DTFF2022" 


6. (optional) if unhappy with Python, install R or Julia or anything of your choice;

RStudio


7. install git and create an account on GitHub;

git version 2.37.0 (Apple Git-136)


8. make sure you can run git from the command line (on Windows, you can install git bash to emulate the terminal for git-related commands).

git -v
