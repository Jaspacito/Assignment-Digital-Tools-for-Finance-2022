# Using the shell of your choice:


# 1. write a bash script (one you could execute on a Linux server) called 'runner.sh' which prints the message provided by the user as an argument to the script; 
# for instance,
# ./runner.sh 'hello'
# is supposed to display "hello";

# create file and open vim editor 
vim runner.sh 
# open edit mode in vim 
i 

# main part of .sh file 
#!/bin/bash
echo $1

# press ESC to exit edit mode 

# save the file and exit vim 
:wq 

# add the execute permission 
chmod 777 runner.sh

# run the command 
./runner.sh 'hello' 


# 2. write a text document describing the steps necessary for a user without superuser privileges to create a cron job on a Linux server that runs every second day at 17:00 executing script "runner.sh 'hello'" (no need to create the job, just describe the steps);

# step 1: edit the cron jobs of the user without superuser privileges 
crontab -u username -e 
# step 2: press i to enter edit mode of vim and edit cron jobs 
0 17 * * 2 username /Users/username/temp/runner.sh 'hello' 
# copy this to a .txt file 


# 3. place all files above in folder "homework/week1" (you will commit and push them once we've covered version control).
