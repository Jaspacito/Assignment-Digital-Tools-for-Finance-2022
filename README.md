# Final Project Overview 


## Topic 

The Markowitz-Optimal Portfolio Strategies Under Inflation 


## Background 

As a result of the covid-19 shock, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, global inflation has reached its highest level since 2008 in recent years. More than half of the countries with inflation-targeting frameworks have exceeded their target rates. For many households around the world, rising inflation poses a significant challenge. Inflation reduces the real purchasing power of investors' asset holdings, affecting investment returns and shrinking real wealth. Therefore, in the current context of rising price levels, it is of great theoretical and practical importance to study the inflation-hedging characteristics of various asset classes and to construct the optimal portfolios with inflation-hedging features. 


## Introduction 

The main purpose of this research is to test the inflation hedging ability of different categories of important financial assets, for example, commodity futures, real estate, gold, industry stocks, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and so on, and then to select the assets that can effectively combat inflation risk to construct the inflation hedging portfolio using mean-variance model. 


## Data 

Inflation data can be obtained from the websites of World Bank or from national central banks. The data of financial assets can be obtained from Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance, etc. Given that the center of this research is inflation, it is expected to use long-term data, e.g. ten-year monthly data.
